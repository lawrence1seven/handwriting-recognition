As the name suggests, the handwritten Character recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten characters. Or in easy words we can say that it is the ability of computers to detect the character present in a particular image and recognize that character.By leveraging the power of advanced algorithms and large datasets, ML is poised to help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of  handwriting recognition.

Developers are putting all their strength to make machines more intelligent, and smarter than humans. Deep learning is one such technique that contributes to developers enhancing machines. To memorize how a task is performed, what do humans do? Humans keep practicing and repeating that task again and again so that they get proficient in that task. After some time our brain neurons can automatically trigger and perform the task quickly and accurately. Likewise, deep learning follows the approach to solving a problem. Various types of neural network architectures are used by deep learning algorithms to solve different types of problems.
