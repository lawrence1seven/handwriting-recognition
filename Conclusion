●The machine learning model developed using the alphabet data set can accurately predict letters from handwritng.
●The model's performance can be further improved by incorporating additional features or by using more advanced machine learning algorithms.
●In the future, it will be important to validate our model on larger and more diverse datasets, and to explore the potential of machine learning in other areas of cancer research and treatment.
●Our findings have important implications for image recognition, as our model can accurately recognize letters from given pictures
